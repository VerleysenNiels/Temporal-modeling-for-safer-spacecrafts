# Temporal-modeling-for-safer-spacecrafts
Main experiment of my thesis: Temporal modeling for safer spacecrafts. In this repository I use an LSTM network for forecasting of multiple time series coming from spacecraft sensors. I am using a subset of sensors from the Mars Express orbiter. By thresholding the loss of this predictor we can determine if the measurements from the spacecraft are anomalous or not.
